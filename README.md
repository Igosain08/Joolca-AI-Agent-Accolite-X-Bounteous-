  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  metadata JSONB NOT NULL,
  embedding VECTOR(1536)
);
```

- `customer_email`: Customer contact information
- `resolved`: Resolution status (boolean)
- `region`: Customer geographic region
- `type`: Issue category (damage, delivery, setup, warranty)
- `status`: Current ticket status
- `source`: Data source identifier

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted)
- Supabase account with vector extension enabled
- OpenAI API key
- Zendesk account (optional, for escalation)
- Gmail account (optional, for notifications)

### 1. Database Setup
```sql
-- Run this once to create the support tables
-- (Available in the "Create Support Tables" node)
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS support_knowledge (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  metadata JSONB NOT NULL,
  embedding VECTOR(1536)
);

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION match_support_knowledge(
  query_embedding VECTOR(1536),
  match_count INT DEFAULT 5,
  filter JSONB DEFAULT '{}'
) RETURNS TABLE (
  id BIGINT,
  content TEXT,
  metadata JSONB,
  similarity FLOAT
);
```

### 2. n8n Workflow Import
1. Import the `final rag.json` file into your n8n instance
2. Configure the following credentials:
   - **OpenAI API**: Your OpenAI API key
   - **Supabase**: Database URL and service key
   - **Zendesk API**: Zendesk domain and API token
   - **Gmail OAuth2**: Gmail account for notifications
   - **PostgreSQL**: Database connection for chat memory

### 3. Data Loading
1. Execute the "When clicking 'Execute workflow'" trigger
2. This will download and process historical support data from GitHub
3. Data is automatically embedded and stored in the vector database

### 4. Webhook Configuration
- The workflow exposes a webhook endpoint for receiving customer queries
- Configure your frontend/chat interface to send POST requests to the webhook
- Expected payload format:
```json
{
  "customerQuery": "How do I set up my HOTTAP?",
  "sessionId": "unique-session-id",
  "productMentioned": "HOTTAP"
}
```
